Keeping your existing transaction history is important. If you already usy a different app, you probably want to migrate it over into Actual.

Right now, only YNAB4 is officially supported. However, the [API](/docs/developers/API/) allows anyone to write a custom importer. We will work with the community to help write other importers soon.

## Migrating from YNAB4

* Go to the **Create new file** screen (this is the first screen you see on first launch).
* Click **Importâ€¦**
* All of your existing YNAB4 budgets should be listed. Select the one you want to import.
* Click **Import**
* That's it!

## Migration from other apps

YNAB4 is the only builtin importer right now. We're hoping the community can help build other importers on top of the [API](/docs/developers/API/).
